        overview:
            "Butter.DB is a small, single-page web application that allows users to get information on movies based on what’s trending, popular, upcoming, and new releases. This application fetches data from the TMDB Rest API that outputs and updates them in real-time onto a component making it completely dynamic. This is by far one of the more challenging projects I have completed during my time at BCIT. However, building this web application made me fall head over heels with React and Javascript.",

        design: `I created high-fidelity mockups using Photoshop and Adobe XD throughout our design tools course. Although it’s not identical to the final product, I wanted to keep parts of my initial layout once I started with the development phase. For the basic design, I wanted to use colors that are dark and easy on the eyes. Considering that the backbone of this project was to re-create IMDB and TMDB, I wanted to keep their layout that's familiar to users.`,
