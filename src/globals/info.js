            "Butter.DB is a small, single-page web application that allows users to get information on movies based on whatâ€™s trending, popular, upcoming, and new releases. This application fetches data from the TMDB Rest API that outputs and updates them in real-time onto a component making it completely dynamic. This is by far one of the more challenging projects I have completed during my time at BCIT. However, building this web application made me fall head over heels with React and Javascript.",
